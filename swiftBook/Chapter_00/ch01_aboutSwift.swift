//    swift is a safe, fast, and interactive programming language that combines the best in modern language thinking
//    Swift is friendly to new programmers. It‚Äôs an industrial-quality programming language that‚Äôs as expressive and enjoyable as a scripting language.
//    Swift defines away large classes of common programming errors by adopting modern programming patterns:
//    Variables are always initialized before use.
//    Array indices are checked for out-of-bounds errors.
//    Integers are checked for overflow.
//    Optionals ensure that nil values are handled explicitly.
//    Memory is managed automatically.
//    Error handling allows controlled recovery from unexpected failures.

//    Its combination of safety and speed make Swift an excellent choice for everything from ‚ÄúHello, world!‚Äù to an entire operating system.
//    Swift combines powerful type inference and pattern matching
//    Swift has been years in the making, and it continues to evolve with new features and capabilities.

//    Swift is a new programming language for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS apps that builds on the best of C and Objective-C,
//    without the constraints of C compatibility.
     
//     Swift adopts safe programming patterns and adds modern features to make programming easier, more flexible, and more fun.
//     Objective-C itself has evolved to support blocks, collection literals, and modules,

     ‚Äúenabling framework adoption of modern language technologies without disruption. Thanks to this groundwork,
     we can now introduce a new language for the future of Apple software development.
     
     Swift feels familiar to Objective-C developers.
     It adopts the readability of Objective-C‚Äôs named parameters and the power of Objective-C‚Äôs dynamic object model.
     It provides seamless access to existing Cocoa frameworks and mix-and-match interoperability with Objective-C code.
     Building from this common ground, Swift introduces many new features and unifies the procedural and object-oriented portions of the language.

     Objective C dynamic type
     A variable is dynamically typed when the type of the object it points to is not checked at compile time. Objective-C uses the id data type to represent a variable that is an object without specifying what sort of object it is. This is referred to as dynamic typing.
     
     
     Swift is friendly to new programmers. It is the first industrial-quality systems programming language that is as expressive and enjoyable as a scripting language.
     It supports playgrounds, an innovative feature that allows programmers to experiment with Swift code and see the results immediately,
     without the overhead of building and running an app.
     
     Swift combines the best in modern language thinking with wisdom from the wider Apple engineering culture.
     The compiler is optimized for performance, and the language is optimized for development,
     without compromising on either. It‚Äôs designed to scale from ‚Äúhello, world‚Äù to an entire operating system.
     All this makes Swift a sound future investment for developers and[‚Ä¶]‚Äù
