    //The count of the characters returned by the characters property is not always the same as the length property of an NSString that contains the same characters. The length of an NSString is based on the number of 16-bit code units within the string‚Äôs UTF-16 representation and not the number of Unicode extended grapheme clusters within the string.‚Äù
    
    
    //Each String value has an associated index type, String.Index, which corresponds to the position of each Character in the string.
    
   // As mentioned above, different characters can require different amounts of memory to store, so in order to determine which Character is at a particular position, you must iterate over each Unicode scalar from the start or end of that String. For this reason, Swift strings cannot be indexed by integer values.‚Äù
