    // Closures are self-contained blocks of functionality that can be passed around and used in your code.
    // Closures in Swift are similar to blocks in C and Objective-C and to lambdas in other programming languages.
    
    
//        Closures take one of three forms:
//
//        Global functions are closures that have a name and donâ€™t capture any values.
//        Nested functions are closures that have a name and can capture values from their enclosing function.
//        Closure expressions are unnamed closures written in a lightweight syntax that can capture values from their surrounding context.
    
//    Closures are made brief and clutter free using these optimizations
//
//    Inferring parameter and return value types from context
//    Implicit returns from single-expression closures
//    Shorthand argument names
//    Trailing closure syntax

    //both of those constants or variables refer to the same closure.
