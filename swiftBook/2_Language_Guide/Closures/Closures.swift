// [Closures]
    //Closures are self-contained blocks of functionality that can be passed around and used in your code.
    //Closures in Swift are similar to blocks in C and Objective-C and to lambdas in other programming languages.
    //Closures can capture and store references to any constants and variables from the context in which theyâ€™re defined.
    //This is known as closing over those constants and variables. Swift handles all of the memory management of capturing for you.

    //Closures take one of three forms:
    // - Global functions are closures that have a name and donâ€™t capture any values.
    // - Nested functions are closures that have a name and can capture values from their enclosing function.
    // - Closure expressions are unnamed closures written in a lightweight syntax that can capture values from their surrounding context.

    //Swiftâ€™s closure expressions have a clean, clear style, with optimizations that encourage brief, clutter-free syntax in common scenarios. These optimizations include:
    // - Inferring parameter and return value types from context
    // - Implicit returns from single-expression closures
    // - Shorthand argument names
    // - Trailing closure syntax

//        runningTotal += amount
//        return runningTotal

//let incrementByTen = makeIncrementer(forIncrement: 10)
//

//// returns a value of 10
//incrementByTen()

//incrementByTen()
//// returns a value of 30
//
//
//let incrementBySeven = makeIncrementer(forIncrement: 7)
//incrementBySeven()
//// returns a value of 7
//
//incrementByTen()
//// returns a value of 40
//
//
//let alsoIncrementByTen = incrementByTen
//alsoIncrementByTen()
//// returns a value of 50
//
//incrementByTen()
//// returns a value of 60
//
////The example above shows that calling alsoIncrementByTen is the same as calling incrementByTen.
////Because both of them refer to the same closure, they both increment and return the same running total.
//
//
//
//
//
//// ðŸŸ© Closures Are Reference Types
//
////In the example above, incrementBySeven and incrementByTen are constants,
////but the closures these constants refer to are still able to increment the runningTotal variables that they have captured.
////This is because functions and closures are reference types.
//
////This also means that if you assign a closure to two different constants or variables,
////both of those constants or variables refer to the same closure.
//

// ðŸŸ© [Escaping Closures]
// A closure is said to escape a function when the closure is passed as an argument to the function, but is called after the function returns. When you declare a function that takes a closure as one of its parameters, you can write @escaping before the parameterâ€™s type to indicate that the closure is allowed to escape.

// An escaping closure that refers to self needs special consideration if self refers to an instance of a class. Capturing self in an escaping closure makes it easy to accidentally create a strong reference cycle.
                                                                        
class Closures1 {
    var completionHandlers: [() -> Void] = []

    func someFunctionWithEscapingClosure(completionHandler: @escaping () -> Void) {
        completionHandlers.append(completionHandler)
    }
    
    func run1() {
        someFunctionWithEscapingClosure() {
            print("z")
        }
        completionHandlers.first?()
        completionHandlers.first?()
    }

    //
    
    func run2() {
        func howAreYou(_ responseHandler: @escaping (String) -> Void) {
            print("Hey, how are you?") // you ask how are you
          
            // Simulating how it takes 2 seconds for your friend to answer:
            // This way you tell the program that the responseHandler is an asynchronous closure and you want it to stay alive even after howAreYou call completes.
            DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 8, execute: {
                responseHandler("Hi, I'm doing really good.")
            })
          
            print("Responding takes a while...")
        }
        howAreYou({ friendResponse in
            print(friendResponse) // print the response that arrives later
        })
    }
    
    
    //

}

//Escaping closures are useful whenever you want the closure to be able to outlive the functionâ€™s scope from where you are calling it.
//
//A great example is when dealing with network requests.
