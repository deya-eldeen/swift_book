// [ðŸ”· Opaque Types]
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// ** In programming languages, an abstract type is a type in a nominative type system that cannot be instantiated directly
// ** a type that is not abstract â€“ which can be instantiated â€“ is called a concrete type.

// ** Opaque types mask your concrete types, this help you to hide private API and type transformation
// ** The caller will use a view (Prototype type), but swift underlying is working with the concrete type, this allows optimization at compilation time vs regular protocols.

// A function or method with an opaque return type hides its return valueâ€™s type information.
// Instead of providing a concrete type as the functionâ€™s return type, the return value is described in terms of the protocols it supports.
// Hiding type information is useful at boundaries between a module and code that calls into the module, because the underlying type of the return value can remain private.
// Unlike returning a value whose type is a protocol type, opaque types preserve type identityâ€”the compiler has access to the type information, but clients of the module donâ€™t.

// This approach to defining a JoinedShape<T: Shape, U: Shape> structure that joins two shapes together vertically, like the code below shows, results in types like JoinedShape<FlippedShape<Triangle>, Triangle> from joining a flipped triangle with another triangle.

// [ðŸ”· Returning an Opaque Type]
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// You can think of an opaque type like being the reverse of a generic type. Generic types let the code that calls a function pick the type for that functionâ€™s parameters and return value in a way thatâ€™s abstracted away from the function implementation. For example, the function in the following code returns a type that depends on its caller:

// func max<T>(_ x: T, _ y: T) -> T where T: Comparable { ... }

// The code that calls max(_:_:) chooses the values for x and y, and the type of those values determines the concrete type of T.
// The calling code can use any type that conforms to the Comparable protocol.
// The code inside the function is written in a general way so it can handle whatever type the caller provides. The implementation of max(_:_:) uses only functionality that all Comparable types share.

// Those roles are reversed for a function with an opaque return type. An opaque type lets the function implementation pick the type for the value it returns in a way thatâ€™s abstracted away from the code that calls the function. For example, the function in the following example returns a trapezoid without exposing the underlying type of that shape.

struct Square: Shape {
    var size: Int
    func draw() -> String {
        let line = String(repeating: "*", count: size)
        let result = Array<String>(repeating: line, count: size)
        return result.joined(separator: "\n")
    }
}

func makeTrapezoid() -> some Shape {
    let top = Triangle(size: 5)
    let middle = Square(size: 6)
    let bottom = FlippedShape(shape: top)
    let trapezoid = JoinedShape(
        top: top,
        bottom: JoinedShape(top: middle, bottom: bottom)
    )
    return trapezoid
}

let trapezoid = makeTrapezoid() //JoinedShape<Triangle, JoinedShape<Square, FlippedShape<Triangle>>>
print("trapezoid")
print(trapezoid.draw())

//*
//**
//***
//****
//*****
//******
//******
//******
//******
//******
//******

//***
//**
//*

// - The makeTrapezoid() function in this example declares its return type as some Shape; as a result, the function returns a value of some given type that conforms to the Shape protocol, without specifying any particular concrete type. Writing makeTrapezoid() this way lets it express the fundamental aspect of its public interfaceâ€”the value it returns is a shapeâ€”without making the specific types that the shape is made from a part of its public interface. This implementation uses two triangles and a square, but the function could be rewritten to draw a trapezoid in a variety of other ways without changing its return type.

// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// - This example highlights the way that an opaque return type is like the reverse of a generic type.
// The code inside makeTrapezoid() can return any type it needs to, as long as that type conforms to the Shape protocol, like the calling code does for a generic function.
// The code that calls the function needs to be written in a general way, like the implementation of a generic function, so that it can work with any Shape value thatâ€™s returned by makeTrapezoid().

// - You can also combine opaque return types with generics.
// The functions in the following code both return a value of some type that conforms to the Shape protocol.

func flip<T: Shape>(_ shape: T) -> some Shape {
    return FlippedShape(shape: shape)
}
func join<T: Shape, U: Shape>(_ top: T, _ bottom: U) -> some Shape {
    JoinedShape(top: top, bottom: bottom)
}

let opaqueJoinedTriangles = join(smallTriangle, flip(smallTriangle)) //JoinedShape<Triangle, FlippedShape<Triangle>>
print("opaqueJoinedTriangles")
print(opaqueJoinedTriangles.draw())



// The value of opaqueJoinedTriangles in this example is the same as joinedTriangles in the generics example in the The Problem That Opaque Types Solve section earlier in this chapter.
// However, unlike the value in that example, flip(_:) and join(_:_:) wrap the underlying types that the generic shape operations return in an opaque return type, which prevents those types from being visible.
// Both functions are generic because the types they rely on are generic, and the type parameters to the function pass along the type information needed by FlippedShape and JoinedShape.


// If a function with an opaque return type returns from multiple places, all of the possible return values must have the same type.
// For a generic function, that return type can use the functionâ€™s generic type parameters, but it must still be a single type.
// For example, hereâ€™s an invalid version of the shape-flipping function that includes a special case for squares:


//func invalidFlip<T: Shape>(_ shape: T) -> some Shape {
//    if shape is Square {
//        return shape // Error: return types don't match
//    }
//    return FlippedShape(shape: shape) // Error: return types don't match
//}

// If you call this function with a Square, it returns a Square; otherwise, it returns a FlippedShape.
// This violates the requirement to return values of only one type and makes invalidFlip(_:) invalid code.
// One way to fix invalidFlip(_:) is to move the special case for squares into the implementation of FlippedShape, which lets this function always return a FlippedShape value:
struct FlippedShapeExcludingSquare<T: Shape>: Shape {
    var shape: T
    func draw() -> String {
        if shape is Square {
            return shape.draw()
        }
        let lines = shape.draw().split(separator: "\n")
        return lines.reversed().joined(separator: "\n")
    }
}

// The requirement to always return a single type doesnâ€™t prevent you from using generics in an opaque return type.
// Hereâ€™s an example of a function that incorporates its type parameter into the underlying type of the value it returns:
func `repeat`<T: Shape>(shape: T, count: Int) -> some Collection {
    return Array<T>(repeating: shape, count: count)
}

// In this case, the underlying type of the return value varies depending on T: Whatever shape is passed it, repeat(shape:count:)
// creates and returns an array of that shape. Nevertheless, the return value always has the same underlying type of [T],
// so it follows the requirement that functions with opaque return types must return[â€¦]


// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// [ðŸ”· Differences Between Opaque Types and Protocol Types]
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Returning an opaque type looks very similar to using a protocol type as the return type of a function,
// but these two kinds of return type differ in whether they preserve type identity. An opaque type refers to one specific type,
// although the caller of the function isnâ€™t able to see which type; a protocol type can refer to any type that conforms to the protocol.
// Generally speaking, protocol types give you more flexibility about the underlying types of the values they store,
// and opaque types let you make stronger guarantees about those underlying types.
// For example, hereâ€™s a version of flip(_:) that uses a protocol type as its return type instead of an opaque return type:

func protoFlip<T: Shape>(_ shape: T) -> Shape {
    return FlippedShape(shape: shape)
}

// This version of protoFlip(_:) has the same body as flip(_:), and it always returns a value of the same type. Unlike flip(_:),
// the value that protoFlip(_:) returns isnâ€™t required to always have the same typeâ€”it just has to conform to the Shape protocol.
// Put another way, protoFlip(_:) makes a much looser API contract with its caller than flip(_:) makes.
// It reserves the flexibility to return values of multiple types:

func protoFlipNotSquare<T: Shape>(_ shape: T) -> Shape {
    if shape is Square {
        return shape
    }
    return FlippedShape(shape: shape)
}

//The revised version of the code returns an instance of Square or an instance of FlippedShape,
// depending on what shape is passed in. Two flipped shapes returned by this function might have completely different types.
// Other valid versions of this function could return values of different types when flipping multiple instances of the same shape.
// The less specific return type information from protoFlip(_:) means that many operations that depend on type information arenâ€™t available on the returned value.
// For example, itâ€™s not possible to write an == operator comparing results returned by this function.
let protoFlippedTriangle = protoFlip(smallTriangle)
let sameThing = protoFlipNotSquare(smallTriangle)
// protoFlippedTriangle == sameThing  // Error : Binary operator '==' cannot be applied to two 'any Shape' operands

// The error on the last line of the example occurs for several reasons. The immediate issue is that the Shape doesnâ€™t include an == operator as part of its protocol requirements.
// If you try adding one, the next issue youâ€™ll encounter is that the == operator needs to know the types of its left-hand and right-hand arguments.
// This sort of operator usually takes arguments of type Self, matching whatever concrete type adopts the protocol,
// but adding a Self requirement to the protocol doesnâ€™t allow for the type erasure that happens when you use the protocol type
                                                        

// Another problem with this approach is that the shape transformations donâ€™t nest.

// The result of flipping a triangle is a value of type Shape, and the protoFlip(_:) function takes an argument of some type that conforms to the Shape protocol.
// However, a value of a protocol type doesnâ€™t conform to that protocol; the value returned by protoFlip(_:) doesnâ€™t conform to Shape.
// This means code like protoFlip(protoFlip(smallTriange)) that applies multiple transformations is invalid because the flipped shape isnâ€™t a valid argument to protoFlip(_:).
// In contrast, opaque types preserve the identity of the underlying type. Swift can infer associated types,
// which lets you use an opaque return value in places where a protocol type canâ€™t be used as a return value.
// For example, hereâ€™s a version of the Container protocol from Generics:

protocol Container {
    associatedtype Item
    var count: Int { get }
    subscript(i: Int) -> Item { get }
}
extension Array: Container { }


// You canâ€™t use Container as the return type of a function because that protocol has an associated type.
// You also canâ€™t use it as constraint in a generic return type because there isnâ€™t enough information outside the function body to infer what the generic type needs to be.
// Error: Protocol with associated types can't be used as a return type.
//func makeProtocolContainer<T>(item: T) -> Container {
//    return [item]
//}

// Error: Not enough information to infer C.
//func makeProtocolContainer<T, C: Container>(item: T) -> C {
//    return [item]
//}

// Using the opaque type some Container as a return type expresses the desired API contractâ€”the function returns a container,
// but declines to specify the containerâ€™s type:
func makeOpaqueContainer<T>(item: T) -> some Container {
    return [item]
}
let opaqueContainer = makeOpaqueContainer(item: 12)
let twelve = opaqueContainer[0]
print(type(of: twelve))
// Prints "Int"

// The type of twelve is inferred to be Int, which illustrates the fact that type inference works with opaque types.
// In the implementation of makeOpaqueContainer(item:), the underlying type of the opaque container is [T]. In this case,
// T is Int, so the return value is an array of integers and the Item associated type is inferred to be Int.
// The subscript on Container returns Item, which means that the type of twelve is also inferred to be Int.
