    //
    //

    shoppingList[0] = "Six eggs"
    
    //When you use subscript syntax, the index you specify needs to be valid. For example, writing shoppingList[shoppingList.count] = "Salt" to try to append an item to the end of the array results in a runtime error.

    }
    
    
    //If you need the integer index of each item as well as its value, use the enumerated() method to iterate over the array instead. For each item in the array, the enumerated() method returns a tuple composed of an integer and the item. The integers start at zero and count up by one for each item; if you enumerate over a whole array, these integers match the items‚Äô indices. You can decompose the tuple into temporary constants or variables as part of the iteration:
    
        
    for (index, value) in shoppingList.enumerated() {
        print("Item \(index + 1): \(value)")
    }
    
    
    
    //
    //
    //Sets : A set stores distinct values of the same type in a collection with no defined ordering. You can use a set instead of an array when the order of items is not important, or when you need to ensure that an item only appears once.
    //
    //
    
    
    /*
    You can use your own custom types as set value types or dictionary key types by making them conform to the Hashable protocol from Swift‚Äôs standard library. Types that conform to the Hashable protocol must provide a gettable Int property called hashValue. The value returned by a type‚Äôs hashValue property is not required to be the same across different executions of the same program, or in different programs.
    
    Because the Hashable protocol conforms to Equatable, conforming types must also provide an implementation of the equals operator (==). The Equatable protocol requires any conforming implementation of == to be an equivalence relation. That is, an implementation of == must satisfy the following three conditions, for all values a, b, and c:
    
    a == a (Reflexivity)
    
    a == b implies b == a (Symmetry)
    
    a == b && b == c implies a == c (Transitivity)‚Äù
